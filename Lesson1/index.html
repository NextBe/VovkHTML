The family first appeared on The Tracey Ullman Show, in the comedy short Good Night. The family has hundreds of relatives, including Mr. Burns and Patty and Selma.</p><p>The Simpsons (often shortened to Simpsons) is an American animated sitcom created by Matt Groening for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The main characters are a satire of a working-class family, consisting of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. The series lampoons many aspects of American culture, society, politics, and history.</p><p>The Simpsons was conceived in the lobby of James L. Brooks's office by Matt Groening. He was asked to do a series of animated shorts, and decided to do his Life in Hell series; since he realized that animating Life in Hell would require the rescinding of publication rights for his life's work, he chose another approach and formulated his version of a dysfunctional family. He named the characters after his own family and substituted Bart for his own name, as it was an anagram of 'brat'.</p><h2>    <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Homer_Simpson" target="_blank">Homer Simpson</a></h2>    <img src="imgl1/Homer.png" alt="Homer">    <p>Homer Jay Simpson (born May 12, 1956) is the main protagonist of The Simpsons series (or show).

He also serves as the main protagonist of the The Simpsons Movie.</p><ul>        <li>“Shut up Flanders!”</li>        <li>“Whatever, I'll be at Moe's.”</li>        <li>“Better them than me.”</li>    </ul><h2>    <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Marge_Simpson" target="_blank">Marge Simpson</a></h2><img src="imgl1/Marge.png" alt="Marge">    <p>Marjorie Jacqueline "Marge" Simpson is the homemaker and matriarch of the Simpson family. She is also one of the five main characters in The Simpsons TV series. Marge is 37 years of age. She and her husband Homer have three children: Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. Marge is the moralistic force in her family and often provides a grounding voice in the midst of her family's antics by trying to maintain order in the Simpson household. Aside from her duties at home, Marge has flirted briefly with a number of careers ranging from a police officer to an anti-violence activist.</p>    <p>Marge Bouvier was born on in Capital City to Clancy Bouvier, a photographer-turned-steward, and Jacqueline Bouvier.

She was named after a train called Lil' Lisa on her parents' 1st anniversary. She is a charismatic 8-year-old girl, who exceeds the standard achievement of the intelligence level of children her age. Not to everyone's surprise, she is also the moral center of her family. In her upbringing, Lisa lacks parental involvement of Homer and Marge, which leads to hobbies such as playing saxophone and guitar, riding and caring for horses, and interest in advanced studies. In school, Lisa's popularity is affected by those who view her as a geeky overachiever, which leaves her with only a few friends. She focuses on her goals and strives to reach her potential, and at the age of eight, she is already a member of Mensa with an IQ of 159. Her lack of parental involvement also leads to her lashing out to those who she deems lower than her or even above her. She has extreme jealously from time to time and will do whatever it takes to reclaim her title as the smartest; but only if she deems it necessary. Otherwise, she's the intelligent one who usually thinks things through.</p> <ul>     <li>“Shut up, Meg”</li>     <li>“I hope these are recyclable.”</li>     <li>“If anyone wants me, I'll be in my room.”</li> </ul></body></html>
