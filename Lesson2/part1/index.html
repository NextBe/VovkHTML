        <h2>Creation</h2>
        <p>Groening conceived of the idea for the Simpsons in the lobby of James L. Brooks's office. Brooks had asked
            Groening to pitch an idea for a series of animated shorts, which Groening initially intended to present as
            his Life in Hell series. However, when Groening realized that animating Life in Hell would require the
            rescinding of publication rights for his life's work, he chose another approach and formulated his version
            of a dysfunctional family.[1] He named the characters after his own family members â€“ his father Homer, his
            mother Margaret, and his younger sisters Lisa and Maggie. He substituted "Bart", an anagram of "brat", for
            his own name,[2] and modeled the character after his older brother, Mark.[3][4]

            The five family members were given simple designs so that their facial emotions could easily be changed with
            almost no effort[5] and so that they would be recognizable in silhouette.[6] Groening submitted only basic
            sketches to the animators and assumed that the figures would be cleaned-up in production. However, the
            animators merely re-traced his drawings, which led to the crude appearance of the characters in the initial
            short episodes.[2] The Simpson family made their debut on April 19, 1987, in The Tracey Ullman Show short
            "Good Night".[7] In 1989, the shorts were adapted into The Simpsons, a half-hour series airing on the Fox
            Broadcasting Company. The Simpson family remained the main characters on this new show.[8]</p>
